### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Darren!

Welcome to my GitHub! Here's a quick glimpse into my professional life and some fun tidbits:

ðŸ”­ **What I'm working on:** Currently, I'm developing a tool called **JsonEncryptor**, designed to enhance security by encrypting and decrypting `appsettings.json` files.

ðŸŒ± **What I'm learning:** Iâ€™m diving deep into **.NET MAUI** as I expand my horizons into mobile app development. Thereâ€™s always something new to learn!

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** Anything related to **.NET, C#, APIs, software architectures, or design patterns**. Iâ€™m here to share what I know and learn from others!

âš¡ **Fun fact:** Years ago, I started a ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/darrenleecsharp)) channel which marked my journey into the .NET world. Check it out for a blast from the past!
