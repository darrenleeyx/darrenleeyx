### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Darren!

Welcome to my GitHub! Here's a quick glimpse into my professional life and some fun tidbits:

ðŸ”­ **What I'm working on:** Currently, I'm developing a tool called **JsonEncryptor**, designed to enhance security by encrypting and decrypting `appsettings.json` files.

ðŸŒ± **What I'm learning:** Iâ€™m diving into **React.js** to expand my skills in web development. Starting to grasp the inner workings of frontend frameworks is both exciting and rewarding!

ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** Anything related to **.NET, C#, APIs, software architectures, or design patterns**. Iâ€™m here to share what I know and learn from others!

âš¡ **Fun fact:** Years ago, I started a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/darrenleecsharp) channel which marked my journey into the .NET world. Check it out for a blast from the past!

ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** Letâ€™s connect! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenleeyx).
