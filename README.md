### Hi there 👋 I'm Darren!

Welcome to my GitHub! Here's a quick glimpse into my professional life and some fun tidbits:

- 🔭 **What I'm working on:** Currently, I'm developing a tool called **JsonEncryptor**, designed to enhance security by encrypting and decrypting `appsettings.json` files. Security in simplicity!

- 🌱 **What I'm learning:** I’m diving deep into **.NET MAUI** as I expand my horizons into mobile app development. There’s always something new to learn!

- 💬 **Ask me about:** Anything related to **.NET, C#, APIs, software architectures, or design patterns**. I’m here to share what I know and learn from others!

- ⚡ **Fun fact:** Years ago, I started a YouTube channel ([DarrenLeeCSharp](https://www.youtube.com/darrenleecsharp)) which marked my journey into the .NET world. Check it out for a blast from the past!

- 📫 **How to reach me:** Let’s connect! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrenleeyx).
